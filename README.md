### Opportunity = Freedom

<p>I am 25 y.o, I am studying to be a front-end developer.<br>
I like to draw pictures, play videogames, ride a skateboard, spend a lot of time listening to music.<br>
One of my hobbies is cybersecurity. I like working with servers, creating my own proxies and VPNs, deploying applications.</p>
